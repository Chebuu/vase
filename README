Visualization of Alignments Structures and Entropy

===========
Configuration:
===========

The configuration file is at src/main/resources/config.properties

If you want the users to be able to submit custom structures, then you must set hsspcache to a valid writable directory. You must also set hsspthreads to the maximum number of simultaneous job submissions. 

If you only want VASE to display the content of a series of VASE-format xml files, then you can set xmlonly to true.

===========
Build & Install
===========

VASE requires maven to compile. You can build the war file using: mvn package. Then deploy it.
